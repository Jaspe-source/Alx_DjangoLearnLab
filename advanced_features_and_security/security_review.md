# Security Review

## Configurations Implemented
- **SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True**  
  Ensures all HTTP traffic is redirected to HTTPS.

- **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)**  
  Enforces browsers to use HTTPS only for one year and includes subdomains with preload enabled.

- **Secure Cookies**  
  Both session and CSRF cookies are marked as secure, transmitted only via HTTPS.

- **HTTP Headers**  
  - `X_FRAME_OPTIONS = DENY`: Protects against clickjacking.  
  - `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF = True`: Prevents MIME-type sniffing.  
  - `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True`: Enables browser-based XSS protection.

## Deployment
- Configured web server (Nginx/Apache) with SSL certificates.
- Redirects all HTTP traffic to HTTPS at the server level.

## Potential Improvements
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
- Add monitoring for SSL certificate expiry.
- Regularly test application security using tools like `OWASP ZAP`.
